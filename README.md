# Demos
Currently containing a demo of using SPICE to determine positions of Cassini, Jupiter, and its moons during the Millennium flyby.

Will need to install SpiceyPy: https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy
Need to know times and names of things. I have other stuff in here like illumination phase.
