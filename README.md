# Demos
Currently containing:

- A demo of using SPICE to determine positions of Cassini, Jupiter, and its moons during the Millennium flyby.
    Will need to install SpiceyPy: https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy
    Need to know times and names of things. I have other stuff in here like illumination phase.
- And a demo of ingesting and plotting data with matplotlib and astropy libraries
